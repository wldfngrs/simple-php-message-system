# simple-php-message-system

## Description
php message system with mysql database support and a captcha verification at login.
I built it in php as I thought it could be good practice, for both software development and using php's extensive library.
It was good practice tbh. mySQL cause, well why not? It's simple to work with and set up! Faced a little challenge with the captcha that I'm looking towards fixing when I come back to this a little later. Thought to share it regardless.

## Usage
Pretty simple, fork the repository and store it in the htdocs folder for whatever servers you're working with (I used Apache)
