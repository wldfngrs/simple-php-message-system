# simple-php-message-system

## Description
php message system with mysql database support and a captcha verification at login
I used php as I didn't find any source materials online with guides to building simple(a little extensive tbh) message systems for new php developers like myself.
It was good practice tbh. mySQL cause, well why not? It's simple to work with and set up! Faced a little challenge with the captcha that I'm looking towards fixing when I come back to this a little later. Thought to share it regardless.

## Usage
Pretty simple, fork the repository and store it in the htdocs folder for whatever servers you're working with (I used Apache)
